# 1
# logn, n, 2n, nlogn, n ** 2, 2 ** n

# 2
# eliminates unnecessary implements of the algorithm process
# Example Solution: They divide the problem into smaller sub-problems, which these smaller problems can be
# much faster and more efficient to solve

# 4
# 1. own function name use
# 2. has base case
# Example Solution: Every recursion solution must have a base case and a recursive case.
# The recursive case must continually move the inputs towards the base case.
