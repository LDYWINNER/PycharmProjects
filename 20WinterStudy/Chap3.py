# Iteration : Code that repeats a list of steps

# In computer science, collections are made by defining a data structure (container) that includes references to objects
# Objects : "a piece of data" + include numbers, strings, dates, ...
# Container : An object that contains other objects

# A list can also be made with no objects
# empty list is still a list
# usually created because the list is needed, but it will be filled later

# Do something with each item in a container
# = "step through" the container to do something to each object
# This type of operation is called 'iteration'

# For loop : the simplest way to "visit" every item in a list
